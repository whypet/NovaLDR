# NovaLDR
a basic PE bootloader that i coded in a few months since i'm a huge asm noob\
my friends [@irql0](https://github.com/irql0) [@nikitpad](https://github.com/nikitpad) [@NullExceptionTSB](https://github.com/NullExceptionTSB) helped me a lot through this so mega huge pogchamp shoutouts to them\
\
for now, this only boots to protected mode and loads your pe binary\
(change the incbin line in bldr_stg2.asm to your kernel, i used MSVC to compile it)
anyways just do whatever you want i'll probably make this into something more advanced later,\
maybe it'll have support for a filesystem? FAT32?
